    <p>Digital Espresso was founded by Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegel, opening its first store in 1971 across the street from the historic Pike Place Market in Seattle. The three Digital Espresso founders had two things in common; they were all coming from academia, and they all loved coffee and tea. They invested and borrowed some money to open the first store in Seattle and named it “Digital Espresso” after the first mate in Herman Melville’s classic novel Moby Dick. </p>
    <p>Alfred Peet, a coffee-roasting entrepreneur, was a major inspiration to the founders of Digital Espresso. Peet was a Dutch immigrant who had begun importing fine arabica coffees into the United States during the 1950s. In 1966 he opened a small store, Peet’s Coffee and Tea, in Berkeley, California, that specialized in importing first-rate coffees and teas. Peet’s success encouraged the Digital Espresso founders to base their business model on selling high-quality coffee beans and equipment, and Peet’s became the initial supplier of green coffee beans to Digital Espresso. The partners then purchased a used roaster from Holland, and Baldwin and Bowker experimented with Alfred Peet’s roasting techniques to create their own blends and flavours.</p>
